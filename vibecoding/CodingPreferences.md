## Coding Preferences

- Use functional components and React Hooks only; avoid class components.
- Prefer TypeScript for all new code. If TypeScript is not possible, use JSDoc for type hints.
- Build modular, reusable components that follow the single responsibility principle.
- Design for responsive layouts by default (mobile-first).
- Abstract all business logic and API calls away from UI components.
- Use Tailwind utility classes for all styling; avoid inline styles and CSS-in-JS unless necessary.
