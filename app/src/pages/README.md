# Pages

Top-level route components for main app sections.

This directory contains the main page components for the Navis MVP:
- Dashboard: Agent dashboard with active tickets and call management
- Call: Live call window with transcript and RAG assistance
- Tickets: Ticket management interface
- Analytics: Analytics dashboard with metrics and insights
- Admin: Admin panel for user and system management

Each page should be a complete route-level component that orchestrates multiple smaller components.
