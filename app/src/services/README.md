# Services

API clients and business logic.

This directory contains:
- API client configurations
- Service classes for different domains (auth, calls, tickets, analytics)
- Data transformation utilities
- Business logic abstractions
- Error handling utilities

All API communication should be centralized here and abstracted away from UI components.
