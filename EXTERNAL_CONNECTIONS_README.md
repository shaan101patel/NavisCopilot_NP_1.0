# External Connections Feature (Coming Soon)

## Overview

The External Connections page serves as a central hub for managing integrations with third-party platforms such as CRMs, databases, email services, and other external systems that integrate with Navis. This feature is currently in the "Coming Soon" section as it's in active development.

## Current Status

⚠️ **Beta Preview**: This feature is currently in preview mode with a disclaimer banner. All functionality works with mock data, but backend integration is pending.

## Features Implemented

### ✅ Core Features
- **Connection Management**: Add, edit, delete, and view external connections
- **Connection Types**: Support for CRM, Database, Email, Calendar, Analytics, and Other
- **Authentication Methods**: API Key, OAuth, Database credentials, and other auth types
- **Status Tracking**: Real-time connection status (Connected/Disconnected/Error/Testing)
- **Connection Testing**: Manual connection testing functionality
- **Last Synced Tracking**: Shows when each connection was last synchronized

### ✅ UI/UX Features
- **Card-based Layout**: Clean, responsive grid layout for connection cards
- **Modal Forms**: Accessible modal dialogs for adding and editing connections
- **Credential Security**: Masked sensitive information with show/hide toggle
- **Status Badges**: Color-coded status indicators
- **Empty State**: Helpful guidance when no connections exist
- **Confirmation Dialogs**: Delete confirmations with warning messages

### ✅ Accessibility
- **Keyboard Navigation**: All interactive elements are keyboard accessible

## Data Structure

### Connection Object
```typescript
interface ExternalConnection {
  id: string
  type: ConnectionType           // CRM, Database, Email, etc.
  serviceName: string           // e.g., "Salesforce", "Supabase"
  accountName: string           // Account or instance identifier
  status: ConnectionStatus      // Connected/Disconnected/Error/Testing
  lastSynced: Date             // Last synchronization timestamp
  credentials: object          // Masked credential storage
  settings?: {
    syncFrequency?: string     // realtime/hourly/daily/weekly
    enabledFeatures?: string[]
    customMappings?: object
  }
  createdAt: Date
  updatedAt: Date
}
```

## Backend Integration Notes

The following endpoints and functionality need to be implemented on the backend:

### API Endpoints Required
```
GET    /api/connections           # List all connections
POST   /api/connections           # Create new connection
GET    /api/connections/:id       # Get connection details
PUT    /api/connections/:id       # Update connection
DELETE /api/connections/:id       # Delete connection
POST   /api/connections/:id/test  # Test connection
```

### Expected Payload Examples

**Create Connection:**
```json
{
  "type": "CRM",
  "serviceName": "Salesforce",
  "accountName": "Navis Production",
  "credentialType": "api",
  "apiKey": "your-api-key",
  "syncFrequency": "hourly"
}
```

**Test Connection Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Connection successful",
  "latency": 150
}
```

## Current State

- ✅ Frontend UI/UX complete
- ✅ TypeScript interfaces defined
- ✅ Mock data and state management
- ✅ All modals and forms functional
- ✅ Routing and navigation integrated
- ⏳ Backend API integration (placeholder comments added)
- ⏳ Real credential validation
- ⏳ Actual connection testing logic

## Testing

Currently uses mock data for demonstration. All CRUD operations work with local state management. Backend integration points are clearly marked with `// IMPLEMENT LATER` comments.

## Next Steps

1. Implement backend API endpoints
2. Add real connection testing logic
3. Implement secure credential storage
4. Add connection health monitoring
5. Add sync status and logs
6. Implement connection-specific settings panels
